	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Me</h1>
	<p class="intro">Hello, I'm Marco Ferraioli, but you might know me as ParanoiaSystem.</p>
	<p>
		I'm a big fan of technology, a developer, and someone who loves to create new things. I've been lucky to work in many different areas of technology, and each one has taught me something new. I've learned how technology changes the way we live and work, and I'm always amazed by its power and potential.
	</p>
	<p>
		I love programming, especially when it comes to working with cloud technologies like containerization and Kubernetes. I'm always looking for new ways to build better and more efficient systems using these tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm also really interested in how we design software and systems. I believe that good design and clean code are crucial for successful software. I enjoy learning about different design patterns, like hexagonal architecture, which can help us build more reliable and easy-to-maintain systems.
	</p>
	<p>
		In my spare time, I like to experiment with things like Internet of Things (IoT), home automation, and electronics. I love playing with microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP32, and using them to make my home smarter and more responsive.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of my hobbies is 3D printing. I find it amazing how we can turn a digital design into a real, physical object. It's a great example of how technology is bringing the digital and physical worlds closer together.
	</p>
	<p>
		On this blog, I'll be sharing my experiences, discoveries, and thoughts about technology. Whether it's a new cloud solution I've found, a design pattern I've been studying, an IoT project I've been working on, or a new 3D print, I'll be talking about it here.
	</p>
	<p>
		I invite you to join me as I explore the world of technology. Whether you're a tech enthusiast yourself or just curious, I hope you'll find something here that inspires and interests you.
